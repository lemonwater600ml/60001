PS1c is my first step to python and coding. It calculates the saving per month for your goal such as a house. I learned to use:
  
	Bisection search  
	The proper timing for using float
  
PS2, A hangman game to complete a word. Just try it. :) If you have no idea for the answer and need a hint. Type in "*". I learned to:
  
	Using function.
	A better way of docstring.
	Loading text outside the py file
	The power of abstraction
	
PS3 is another word game. This time you need to complete words via letters given. If the letter is uncommon in daily conversation such as letter 'z', you get a higher score. Have fun! I learned:
  
	Recursion
	Assertion, try, or exception for different situation
	Import a library 
	
In PS4c, I am capable of delivering a secret message. I wrote a code to encrypt/decrypt a message by Ceasar cipher method and permutating the vowel. I learned that:
  
	Class, storing information, and creating specific method
	Meaning of object-oriented programming
  
Finally, the PS5 is a RSS reader for google news. It allows users to filter specific information from the website. It took a lot of time to debug. I found that the bisection search is very useful while debugging.
	Practice of object oriented programming
	Bisection search in debugging
